# microDriver - SHT2X 
---
MicroBit driver for SHT20, SHT21, SHT25 digital sensor, enabliing the the 
microbit to obtain temperature or relative humidity from these sensors. The 
driver comes in both C++ library and a makecode package for use on the 
[Makecode Microbit Editor](makecode.microbit.org).

## Setup
1. Library Version
    * Include `driver_sht2x.h` for the defintions.
    * Compile you program with `driver_sht2x.c`.
2. Makecode Version
    * Navigate to **Add Package** and enter this repository's URL.
    * Select this package from the results.

## Usage
First ensure that the sensor is _connected properly_ to the MicroBit's I2c pins.
Or the driver will complain with a Microbit panic.

This package/library provides:
1. `read_temperature()` - Read ambient tempreture
    * reads the temperature from the sensor.
    * returns the tempreture as an integer in degree celsius
2. `read_humidity()` - - Read ambient relative humidity
    * reads the relative humidity from the sensor.
    * returns the relative humidity in as a integer percentage.
3.  `set_i2c_address` - Change the i2c address used to address the sensor. By default this is set to `0x40`.

## Troubleshooting
1. MicroBit panics _(displays a frowning face)_ with an error code of 80.
    * The driver was unable to read from the sensor. Check whether the sensor
        is connected properly.
    * If the sensor is connected properly, the driver is still unable to
        detect the sensor, try changing the i2c adddress using 
        `set_i2c_address()`
